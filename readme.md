# **Advent of Code 2021**

I have been a bit shy of python.  I'm not sure why?  But through a stroke of luck I've come upon an opportunity now to spend the winter working with the language on a fun project through the university.  I've decided to use the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) as an opportunity to practice the syntax and become more familiar with the ins-and-outs of Python!

Wish me luck!
